# Temperature Forecast Project

This project aims to predict future temperature values based on historical temperature data using three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The goal is to explore how each model performs on time-series data related to temperature forecasts.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess historical temperature data. The csv file is already clean with no null values.
- **Model Building**: Build and evaluate three models:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Random Forest
- **Prediction**: Generate temperature predictions for future dates.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare the models based on their performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

## Installation

1. Download the csv file :
